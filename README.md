With the aim to classify future complaints based on its content, we used different machine learning algorithms can make more accurate predictions (i.e., classify the complaint in one of the product categories).

The dataset contains different information of complaints that customers have made about a multiple products and services in the financial sector, such us Credit Reports, Student Loans, Money Transfer, etc.
